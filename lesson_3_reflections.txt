When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When other people would need to be aware of it.  IE if naming conventions are affected, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you are working on a repository and it is automatically changed, it may break what you are working on

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are used to make changes that are not included in the master version, this esssentially creates an independant project
  Clone is to make an exact copy of the repo, which can afterward be modified
  Branches are changes that happen in parrallel to the master version, they can be merged back together later.
