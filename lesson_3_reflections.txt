When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When other people would need to be aware of it.  IE if naming conventions are affected, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you are working on a repository and it is automatically changed, it may break what you are working on
